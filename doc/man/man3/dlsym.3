.Dt DLSYM 3
.Sh NAME
.Nm dlsym
.Nd get address of a symbol
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In dlfcn.h
.Ft void*
.Fn dlsym "void* handle" "const char* symbol"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn dlsym
returns the address of the code or data location 
specified by the null-terminated character string
.Fa symbol .
Which libraries and bundles are searched depends on the  
.Fa handle 
parameter. 
.Pp
If
.Fn dlsym
is called with a
.Fa handle ,
returned by
.Fn dlopen
then only that image and any libraries it depends on are searched for
.Fa symbol .
.Pp
If
.Fn dlsym
is called with the special
.Fa handle
.Dv RTLD_DEFAULT ,
then all mach-o images in the process (except those loaded with dlopen(xxx, RTLD_LOCAL))
are searched in the order they were loaded.
This can be a costly search and should be avoided.  
.Pp
If
.Fn dlsym
is called with the special
.Fa handle
.Dv RTLD_NEXT ,
then the search for the symbol is limited to the images which were loaded
after the one issuing the call to
.Fn dlsym .
.Pp
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn dlsym
function
returns a null pointer if the symbol cannot be found, and sets an error
condition which may be queried with
.Fn dlerror .
.Pp
.Sh NOTES
Unlike other dyld API's, the symbol name passed to
.Fn dlsym
must NOT be prepended with an underscore.
